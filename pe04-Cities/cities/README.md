Cities App Functionality
The "Cities App" is an interactive React.js application designed for managing and exploring essential information about various world capitals. Users can seamlessly interact with the app to add and access city details. The process involves user interactions, React.js components, and the integration of the react-router-dom library for efficient routing.

Input
User interactions are the foundation of input in the "Cities App". When users engage with the application, they provide input in the form of details necessary to include a new city within the system. This input includes:

City Name

Process
The application harnesses the power of React.js components and leverages the react-router-dom library to manage the input provided by users and facilitate smooth navigation. The core process of the application unfolds as follows:

State Management: The app maintains an internal state that holds an array of city objects. Each city object encapsulates vital information about the city, such as its name, country, and population.

Add City: Users can expand the city roster by submitting new city details through the intuitive "Add City" form. Upon submission, the application creates a new city object and seamlessly integrates it into the state.

Routing: The program integrates the react-router-dom library to navigate effortlessly between various pages within the app.
