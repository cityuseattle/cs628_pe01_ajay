### Input
An array of movie objects with properties like title, genre, and release year provide the input for the movie application. In addition, a dropdown pick element allows the user to select a genre for the purpose of filtering the movies.

### Process
The logic and rendering of the programme are handled by React components and state management. The movie data and the chosen genre are inputs into the MovieList component. It displays all movies if "All Genres" is selected or filters the list of movies based on the genre you've chosen. The filtered movie list is then displayed as individual movie cards in a section.

The programme also manages user actions like choosing a movie and a genre. The user's selection of a genre updates the genre state, which causes a re-render and displays the filtered movies. When a movie is clicked, an alert displaying the title of the film appears.

### Output
The displayed movie list is the program's output. Each card includes the title, genre, and year of release of the corresponding movie and is displayed in a section. Due to the grid style used, the movie cards are responsive and neatly spaced. By choosing a genre from the dropdown menu and clicking on a movie to display its title in an alert, the user can interact with the movie list.
